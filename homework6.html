	    <h1>Assignment Description</h1>
     	   <p>The big difference with this homework is that we are using a pre existing large database to setup our project. The
		   last homework had us create one from scratch.  In this homework we are tasked to create a paged lookup system that can
		   access the given database and nicely output the contents.  Also, it must be able to create and save reviews as well.</p> 
      	  
	    <hr>
	    <h3>First Steps</h3>
      	    <p>To start out this project, we went to the URL in the assignment to download the necessary Adventureworks Database. At first, the
			raw database starts as a .bak file. It must be unpacked and assigned to the correct  location. For me, I opened SQL server management studios
			and just unpacked it with a right click and selected the correct drop down item. Once that was established I started the project as a
			basic MVC template just like before. However, this time since we have a existing database I was able to create the Model and dbcontext
			through the database first setup tool. This was quite a handy feature as it does create quite a few classes by itself. As well as the dbcontext 
			and connection string in the webconfig area.

	    <h3>HomeController</h3>
      	    <p>Not much to see here. Basically it is just a landing page that links to the actual fun area.</p>

	    
	    <hr>
	    <h3>ProductsController</h1>
      	    <p>This area is the backend for my products searching engine that was needed. I also included the backend for reviews here as well.
			I have shown the first two controller methods. The rest can be seen on the git repo.</p>

	    <h3>Views for each method.</h3>
      	    <p>Next up, I autogenerated and changed as much as I could to create some nice views for each controller function.
			I attached one of the view's code below for an example. The other views are in the git repo as well.</p>

	    <h1>Conclusion </h1>
	    <p>I found during working with this Homework that it was much easier to work with a database that has been created for you. However, it definitely
		shows just how important having a well designed database is since that is where one starts building an application.</p>
