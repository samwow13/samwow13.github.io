      <p>This webpage, and everything linked from it are part of my working portfolio for CS460 senior project.
	  The homework links below are all created in a blog style to show what thought process I went through to complete
	  each homework assignment. Further below, I am linked to any useful cheat sheets or helpful documents.</p>
