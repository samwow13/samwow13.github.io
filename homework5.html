	    <h1>Assignment Description</h1>
     	   <p>Homework five tasks us with creating a simple database using a T-SQL script and connect to it with some basic options. 
			For me, learning T-SQL was the most difficult part as I had a rough time finding good information on the subject.
			Essentially, we needed to create a basic database with a few entrys that were automatically loaded from the script. Then,
			be able to add more through a create form and return to the index and see the added entries. This program will theoretically
			be used to change addresses for people registered through the DMV.</p> 
      	  
	    <hr>
	    <h3>First Steps Up and Down</h3>
      	    <p>These scripts are pretty simple once you actually figure out what your doing. The up.sql script below creates the database, creates the table,
			and adds the first 5 entries. What makes this technique useful is that you can run this script on other machines to start up
			the same project on multiple machines.  The down.sql script just detaches the database, then deletes it.

	    <h3>DbContext class</h3>
      	    <p>I added the DbContext class as shown below, its a simple class that just creates a set and get for our Request
				Controller.</p>
	    <center><img src="images/HW5/DbContext.JPG"></center>
	    
	    <hr>
	    <h3>Model Class</h1>
      	    <p>The model class is basically like creating an interface to use with the database. You can redefine stuff here if needed.
			or just set requirements on fields as shown below.</p>

	    <hr>
	    <h3>Web.config Adding Connection String</h3>
      	    <p>After quite a bit of fiddling I found the correct connection string to use here. Unfortunately, syntax wise it is hard to tell if you 
			are doing this correct the first time. I accidently started by connecting to the SQL server connection string instead of the database that
			I should have been connecting too.  Instead of throwing an understandable error of not being connected, it kept throwing a nullarguementexception
			which I later found out that it wasn't connecting! After adding the correct string everything worked much better.</p>

	    <hr>
	    <h3>Controllers</h3>
      	    <p>The home controller for this project was very simple. It just returned an index view. The request controller is 
			where much of the work is done for creating the views.  The request index view just shows a table of what all is inside
			the database. The request creat view is just a form that the user can input data too.</p>

	    <h3>Home Index View</h3>
     	    <p>This view just links the user to the proper request controller.</p>
	    <center><img src="images/HW5/Home_index_view.JPG"></center>
	    
	    <hr>
	    <h3>Request Index View</h3>
      	    <p>This page displays the information in the Database and nicely outputs the results to a table.</p>

		<center><img src="images/HW5/Request_index_view_part2.JPG"></center>
	    
		<hr>
	    <h3>Request Create View</h3>
      	    <p>The Create form is represented below. I used Razor code to help create this UI as shown.  Essentially, everything below
			is just a form that takes the user input to change an address through the DMV system.</p>

	    <h1>Conclusion </h1>
	    <p>In conclusion, working with a database can be extremely useful and most projects nowadays require one. Learning to use a database
		through MVC has been a learning experience but I am glad I did it. I am looking forward to learning more about entity framework in the 
		next few homeworks to fully understand it.</p>
