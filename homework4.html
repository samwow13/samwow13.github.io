      <h1>Assignment Description</h1>

      <p>The goal of this homework assignment was to get started with MVC and create an application that has no need to connect to a database.
	    Some of the basic end goals of this homework are to learn about: ViewBag / ViewData objects, demonstrate the request command, 
	    learn simple Razor commands, learn what MVC stands for (Models, Views, Controllers), continue our journey on learning C# syntax
	    and key language features.</p>
