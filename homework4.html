	    <h1>Assignment Description</h1>
     	   <p>The goal of this homework assignment was to get started with MVC and create an application that has no need to connect to a database.
	    Some of the basic end goals of this homework are to learn about: ViewBag / ViewData objects, demonstrate the request command, 
	    learn simple Razor commands, learn what MVC stands for (Models, Views, Controllers), continue our journey on learning C# syntax
	    and key language features.</p> 
      	  
	    <hr>
	    <h3>First steps</h3>
      	    <p>I went ahead and started a new MVC project with no template. Then I returned to Git, created a new branch, and proceeded to checkout
	    to that branch to start work on this new project.  Once the program was up and running, I created the controller class by right-clicking
	    the controllers folder, and adding a new blank controller with the name of home.  This controller comes with a call to the index controller
	    with no automatic view.  So first thing is first, lets add a view for index and fill it with the content below.  @html.actionLink events
	    are a simple way to setup multiple pages with links to each of the pages required for this assignment.</p>
	    <center><img src="#" style="width:304px;height:400px;"></center>
	    
	    <hr>  
	    <h3>GetPage()</h3>
      	    <p>Next up, I added the GetPage() method to the controller, and empty view, as well as a view that had all the logic needed to complete
	    the task. Both are shown below.</p>
	    <center><img src="#" style="width:304px;height:400px;"></center>
	    
	    <hr>
	    <h3>Adding the GetPage() View</h1>
      	    <p>Below you will see the code that was required to get this method working. Of course, you have to start by right-clicking the controller again
	    and creating a new view.  From then on its about creating a form that can take an input from the user, which can be sent back to the controller
	    to process and then output the data to the tags below. Unfortunately, this method does take the information input, and put it in the URL above.</p>
	    <center><img src="#" style="width:304px;height:400px;"></center>
      
	    <hr>
	    <h3>PostPage()</h3>
      	    <p>The PostPage method in the controller class has a static empty view, as well as the view needed for the logic to work again.
	    This time, instead of using an empty parameters method, the assignment requires use of a FormCollection object as a parameter
	    to gather information from the input fields we use. This method saves the information to the server instead of just putting it
	    in the URL like the above method.</p>
	    <center><img src="#" style="width:304px;height:400px;"></center>
      
	    <hr>
	    <h3>PostPage() View</h3>
      	    <p>This View is simlar to the last View we created. It is basically just the same type of HTML form created for a new purpose. 
	    That purpose is to show how the [HtmlPost] C# works vs the standard Get.</p>
	    <center><img src="#" style="width:304px;height:400px;"></center>
	    
	    <hr>
	    <h3>LoanCalc()</h3>
     	    <p>The final part of the homework is to create a loan calculator that can take in three inputs, loanTotal, interest, and total time.
	    Below I show the code for accomplishing the backend of the controller.</p>
	    <center><img src="#" style="width:304px;height:400px;"></center>
	    
	    <hr>
	    <h3>LoanCalc() View</h3>
      	    <p>In this view I had to instantiate some initial values using javascript at the top of the page. Then right some logic with the Request
	    method to constantly run, and if a new set of numbers were put in to use those towards the calculations instead of the initial numbers.
	    Other than that it is another form with output below of the results.  I've accounted for bad inputs with HTML limitations as seen in the code.</p>
	    <center><img src="#" style="width:304px;height:400px;"></center>
	    
	    <hr>
	    <h1>Conclusion </h1>
	    <p>In conclusion, after using MVC over a few days it really started to come together in how it works. To me, MVC isn't a coding language,
	    instead it is a framework to make large complex projects more organized and easier to accomplish. So in that respect, even though I was intimidated
	    by it at first when looking into it, I have learned to appreciate what it can do for the average software developer and look forward to 
	    diving deeper into it in the next homework assignments.</p>
