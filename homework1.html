      <h1>Assignment Description</h1>

      <p>In this assignment I was tasked to learn Git from the command line, learn and apply HTML and CSS, learn Bootstrap
	  (Twitter preferably), and of course, create a Git pages account where this website is hosted for free. Over the last summer
	  I took the time to learn as much about twitter bootstrap, HTML, and CSS as possible. So mostly, I had to learn Git and
	  start a Github account for this assignment. Everything else I had done before. I have broken down each part into a section
	  and talk about my step by stepprocess to complete them.</p> <br><br>
	  <hr>
	  <h2>Learning Git Commands</h2>
	  <h3>Git Status</h3>
	  
	  <p>In the world of git, "git status" is a very important concept to initially understand. Git has several different stages
	  that a file can be in during a git status query. One, it can be untracked, which means that Git hasn't tracked this file at all, even 
	  in previous iterations. Two, it can be added from before, but not in the staging area for the next add. Or three, it can be added
	  yet not commited to the next version yet. To start, find the your work area folder and right click, then press "GIT Bash here".</p>
	  
	  	  <pre>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
			</pre>
      <br>
	  <hr>
	  <h3>Git Add</h3>

      <p>Once a file has been staged. The next step is to add said file, or all files needed to the next potential commit.
	  As seen in the bottom line, the index.html file is ready to commit.</p>
	  	  <pre>Sam@LAPTOP-0RE24ICD MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Homework Two/CS460 (master)
$ git add index.html

Sam@LAPTOP-0RE24ICD MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Homework Two/CS460 (master)
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   index.html
</pre>
			<br>
	  <hr>
	  <h3>Git Commit</h3>
      <p>Git commits are in essence the command used to save your local data to a timestamp which can later be retreived.
	  Be mindful of commits as they are not simply erased, and can cause problems if not reasoned about beforehand. The following 
	  syntax is a commit with a predetermined commit name. This avoids bringing up the VI editor automatically.</p>
	  	  <pre>$ git commit -m "Added index file"
[master ca4c496] Added index file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 index.html
</pre>
      <br>
	  <hr>
	  <h3>Git Clone</h3>
      <p>Now that we have the basics, the next step is to create a repository on Github or Bitbucket. They are indeed free,
	  however most do require that your repository remains public until you pay for the website. Once you have your repository
	  created, simply clone from the link on the website and add it as seen below.</p>
	  <pre>$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit</pre>
      <br>
	  <hr>
	  <h3>Setting The Origin</h3>
      <p>This step connects the local repository to your recently made Git repository online.</p>
	  <pre>git remote add origin remote repository https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</pre>
      <br>
	  <hr>
	  <h3>Pushing to the Remote Repository</h3>
	  <p>Once that is all set, you are just one command away from pushing your most recent commit up to your online repository.
	  The following command, does just that.</p>
	  
	  <pre>git push origin master</pre>
	  <br><br><hr>
	  <h1>HTML & CSS & Bootstrap</h1>
	  <p> HTML and CSS are the lifeblood of the internet. They, along with automatic web builders are commonly used throughout
	  society. Bootstrap is a quicker way to get a fairly good looking page up and running fast. 
	  <hr>
	  <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
	  <p>To start with bootstrap, simply add a link tag to your HTML document. In this case, I downloaded the file 
	  directly from getbootstrap.com so it is held locally. Meaning I can make changes, and if changes are made to the online file
	  It won't directly affect your local code. Doing so also means you can work on your code while being offline if need be.</p>
	  <pre><code> link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.css" </code></pre>
	  <hr>
	  <h3>HTML</h3>
	  <p>Below is an example of a basic HTML page. With HTML, everything must be wrapped inside the html brackets. Inside of
	  that, many various elements can be used. Commonly, the header tag is at the top of the page, within that a title can be set 
	  for the page. All of the content for the page itself must be held within the body tags.</p>
	  <code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
&lt;html&gt;<br />
&lt;head&gt;<br />
	&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;/head&gt;<br />
&lt;body&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>

	  
	  <hr>
	  <h3>CSS</h3>
	  <p>CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. Essentially, it is how you change the styling of the given HTML documents.
	  Without it, the internet would be boring and unworthy of your eyes. The code snippet below is a snip of my styles.css file
	  from homework 1.<p>
	  <code>
.greyBack{<br />
	background-color: #e8e8ee;<br />
}<br />
<br />
.middlePic{<br />
	display:block;<br />
	margin: auto;<br />
	<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
#selfPicture{<br />
	display:block;<br />
	margin: auto;<br />
}
	 </code>

	  <h1>My Homework 1</h1>
	  <p>After learning everything above. I wen't on to start by creating my index page. I referred to the bootstrap css file
	  and referred to the classes inside of them with id's and classes to create a stylish, yet basic website. Next, I created my
	  nav bar and made sure everything was working on the main page. After the nav bar was working correctly, I moved on to fill
	  in some basic elements needed for the assignment description. Such as, multi column layout, different list styles, and various
	  elements required by the homework. After I had one working page, I created new files to link my page too, then copy and pasted
	  the content from  my index file to the new sheets, kept everything outside of the body tags and edited them. This makes it easy
	  to make every webpage look the same instead of modifying the code on all pages when a visual change needs to be made.
	  After that was completed, my website just needed filler text which was generated at a ipsum site. The link following this paragraph
	  is to my website which I decided to host on my github pages account. Please, check it out!</p>
